# GitGhost ðŸ‘»
A Python-based automation tool that haunts your Git history with automated commits! It generates and pushes commits over time, making it look like you've been active even when you're not.

 ## Features
- Automates multiple commits over a specified number of days.
- Randomly selects content and commit messages from external files.
- Uses custom commit timestamps to simulate past activity.
- Pushes changes to a remote repository.


## Project Structure
```
    /gitghost
    â”‚â”€â”€ content_code.json     # Contains predefined code contents
    â”‚â”€â”€ content_readme.json   # Contains predefined readme contents
    â”‚â”€â”€ main.py               # Main script to automate commits
    â”‚â”€â”€ README.md             # Documentation file
```


## Setup & Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aswnvm/gitghost.git
   cd gitghost
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required package:
   ```
   pip install gitpython
   ```

## Usage
```
python main.py
```
The script will prompt you for:

    Whether a local repo exists (y/n)
    GitHub username and repo details (if cloning)
    Names of the file to be edited
    Number of days to commit
It will then automatically generate commits and push them to the repository.


## External Files
1. content_code.json\
   Contains content that is randomly added to the selected code file on every commit.

2. content_readme.json\
   Contains content that is randomly added to the selected readme file on every commit.


## How It Works
- Clones the GitHub repository (or uses an existing local repo).\
- Reads commit messages and README content from external files\
- Generates commits over a specified number of days with different timestamps\
- Updates the README.md file with new content on each commit\
- Pushes the commits to the remote repository

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that content_code.json and content_readme.json contain relevant data.\
> The script modifies the README.md file, so use it on repositories where this is acceptable.\
> Push failures may occur if authentication issues arise; make sure you have the correct Git credentials set up.
